=Introduction
LCDProc-Ruby is an object-oriented API to the LCDProc server LCDd.

To get started, take a look at LCDProc::Client since it is the main
interface to LCDd. If you are interested in the status of development,
head over to the TODO to see what outstanding bugs are listed as well
as an overview of the features that are yet to be implemented.

LCDProc-Ruby is released under the open source MIT license.
