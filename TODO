=Introduction

Currently, I am still in the process of stating all of the features that I would like to implement for the 1.0
release. Many aspects of the program are in a working condition and can be used to create a basic program that
talks to the LCDd server. I hope to add much functionality over the next few months and to ensure that the code
structure enables easy extension by other developers (and myself).

=Bug Fixes

Bug fixes are any code/design changes that need to be implemented in order for the API to function properly or
conform to standards.

* Horizontal bar graphs should be able to handle a percentage or a regular integer
* The <tt>menu_add_item</tt> command currently returns two responses and I have inserted a hack to get it to work, a cleaner solution is desired

=Future Enhancements

Any feature requests will be documented here until they can be fully implemented and added into the existing API.
